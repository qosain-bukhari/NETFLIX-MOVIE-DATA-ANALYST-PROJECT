# Netflix Movie Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of over 9,000 movies released on Netflix. The goal is to derive insights to support data-driven business decisions, including determining popular genres, identifying movies with the highest/lowest popularity, and analyzing trends in movie releases over the years.

## Key Questions Addressed
1. What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?
2. Which movie has the highest votes in the `vote_avg` column?
3. What movie has the highest popularity, and what is its genre?
4. What movie has the lowest popularity, and what is its genre?
5. Which year has the most filmed movies?

## Dataset
- The dataset contains information about 9,000+ movies, including columns for:
  - `genre` (e.g., Comedy, Drama, etc.)
  - `popularity`
  - `vote_avg`
  - `release_year`
  - Additional metadata (e.g., title, cast, etc.)

## Approach

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load the dataset using Python (e.g., pandas).
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing or inconsistent values.

2. **Analysis**
   - **Frequent Genre:** Count the occurrences of each genre and identify the most frequent.
   - **Highest Votes:** Find the maximum value in the `vote_avg` column and retrieve the corresponding movie.
   - **Highest and Lowest Popularity:** Determine the movies with the highest and lowest popularity scores and their genres.
   - **Yearly Trends:** Analyze the number of movies released per year and identify the year with the highest count.

3. **Tools Used**
   - Python
   - Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)

## Results
The analysis yields the following insights:
1. Drama's The most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix.
2. Average movie with the highest `vote_avg`.
3. The most popular and least popular movies, along with their genres.
